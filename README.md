# Regression-Research
Research Topic: Higher Dimentional Regression Methods 
Independent Research Project over four months, carried under the supervision of prof. Luai Al Labadi.

Project Objectives:
- Conduct extensive literature review of the topic.
- Exploration of Multicollinearity Handling: Investigate techniques for addressing multicollinearity in high-dimensional regression models, such as Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis or methods tailored for such scenarios.
- Comparison of Regularization Techniques: Compare the performance of different regularization techniques, including Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net, in terms of predictive accuracy and variable selection, highlighting their strengths and limitations.
- Evaluation of Model Performance: Study and analyze model performance evaluation in high-dimensional regression, including metrics like cross-validation, mean squared error, and R-squared adjusted for the number of predictors.
- Comparison with Classical Regression: Compare the performance of high-dimensional regression methods with traditional regression techniques (e.g., ordinary least squares) on datasets with varying levels of dimensionality and complexity.
- Real-world Data Application: Apply the different regression methods studied to real-world datasets with high-dimensional predictor spaces, demonstrating their practical utility and providing insights into specific domains.

Lead to the writing of a 20 page report paper, which is available to be read in pdf format in the repository.
